# Introduction
In a country like India the provision and performance of gov. shelters and NGO camps in certain cases has been hindered by poorly located settings, camp-related social issues, expenses, overcrowding, poor services, delays, etc.
We focus on bringing the victims, NGOs, Government Shelters, Rescue Teams and Private Property owners under one roof through AASHRAY.
AASHRAY will provide a platform for housing to the victims all over India by giving them shelter, food and basic healthcare by linking various NGOs, Government Shelters, Rescue Teams and Volunteers who offer their property as shelter.
